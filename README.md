# Additonal Practice for your First Assessment

Try out these additonal practice problems for more practice for the assessment.

## Setup

1. Download the starter project.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm test` to run all specs.

## Instructions

Your goal is to solve each problem in the __problems/__ folder until all the
test specs pass.

For additional tests that may help with debugging you can comment in
`console.log()` statements in each file, then run
`node <problem-relative-file-path>` in your terminal. For example,
`node problems/01-transpose.js`

You can run tests for specific problems with `npm test test/<problem-spec-file>`.
For example, `npm test test/01-transpose-spec.js`

## Submission

Once all of your specs are passing, prepare your work for submission by:

1. Delete the __/node_modules__ folder.
2. Zip up the entire folder including code and specs.
3. Submit your zipped file.
